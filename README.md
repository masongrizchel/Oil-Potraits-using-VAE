# Oil-Potraits-using-VAE

A simple yet different approach to Oil Portrait Generation using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

This repository showcases a deep learning project that creates original oil portraits from scratch using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Through training on a diverse collection of classical art, this AI-powered system learns the underlying patterns and essence of oil painting techniques, enabling it to generate new, unique artistic expressions.

The paintings generated are abstract in form. This is because the neural network was only trained for 200 epochs due to hardware limitations. Regardless, the outcome still demonstrates the exciting possibility of using machine learning tools to generate compelling works of art.

Added major revisions with the workflow.

Noted some challenges.
